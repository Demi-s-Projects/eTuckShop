### This repository contains the final project for the COMP2171 Group 2 Friday 9-11am B stream

# eTuckShop

A modern web-based tuck shop management system built with Next.js 16 and Firebase. The application supports multiple user roles (Customer, Employee, Owner) with role-specific dashboards and features.

## Deployed on Vercel: [eTuckShop](https://e-tuck-shop.vercel.app/)


**NB**:  Sign up will only allow customer account creation for security purposes. 
> For the sake of this project it is assumed that the tuckshop owner will have their own 'Owner' account as well as a set amount of 'Employee' accounts premade by the administrators as enabling the 'Owner' or 'Employee' role to be selected upon account creation is a security risk.

To access Owner/ Employee role views, use the credentials below:

``` bash
# Owner
Email: owner123@gmail.com
Password: "owner123@gmail.com"

# Employee
Email: employee@gmail.com
Password: "employee@gmail.com"

# Customer
Email: customer123@gmail.com
Password: "customer123@gmail.com"
```
